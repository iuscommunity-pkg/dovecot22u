 #ifdef HAVE_PAM_SETCRED

+/*
+ * This is to fix a bug where dovecot was leaving a lot of temporary
+ * kerberos tickets around and filling up disk space.  If
+ * pam_setcred(pamh, PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED) is called, which creates the
+ * ticket, then a matching pam_setcred(pamh, PAM_DELETE_CRED) also
+ * needs to be called to clean the ticket up. But the only reason to
+ * have a cached ticket on disk is if the service is going to perform
+ * some action during the session that requires access to the ticket
+ * for validation. This implies the pam session is being held open,
+ * which would be more typical pam usage. But the usage here is to
+ * close the pam session immediately after authenticating the user
+ * with pam_end, thus there is no benefit to creating the disk copy of
+ * the ticket. So rather than finding all the early returns before
+ * pam_end is invoked and adding pam_setcred(pamh, PAM_DELETE_CRED) to
+ * each it is more sensible to not create the ticket in the first
+ * place if we're not going to use it and thus not have to worry about
+ * the clean up. Note the way the code is currently structured, with
+ * an immediate call to pam_end() after authentication it implies the
+ * code probably won't work with a file system like AFS which uses the
+ * ticket for file system permissions, but restructuring the code for
+ * this case is beyond the needs of fixing the aforementioned bug.
